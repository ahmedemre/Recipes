    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h4>Dough:</h4>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional, for a richer dough)</li>
        <h4>Filling:</h4>
        <li>200g ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely grated</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin (optional)</li>
        <h4>Toppings:</h4>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika or Aleppo pepper</li>
        <li>Dried mint or parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h4>Prepare the Dough:</h4>
        In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Create a well in the center, add water (and egg, if using), and knead until you have a firm dough. Add a bit more water if it's too dry.
        Cover and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes to make it easier to roll out.
    <li><h4>Prepare the Filling:</h4>
        In a small bowl, mix the ground meat, grated onion, salt, pepper, and cumin (if using). Set aside.
    <li><h4>Roll Out and Fill the Dumplings:</h4>
        Divide the dough into two portions. Roll out one portion on a floured surface until it's very thin (like pasta dough).
        Cut the dough into small squares, about 1-2 cm each.
        Place a small amount of filling (about a pea-sized amount) in the center of each square. Fold the dough over the filling, pinching the edges to seal it well and create tiny dumplings.
        Repeat with the other half of the dough.
    <li><h4>Cook the Manti:</h4>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the manti and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the dumplings float and are cooked through.
        Drain the dumplings and set aside.
    <li><h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4>
        In a small bowl, mix the yogurt with minced garlic and a pinch of salt. Set aside.
        In a separate pan, melt the butter and add paprika or Aleppo pepper, stirring until the butter turns a rich red color. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li><h4>Serve:</h4>
        Place the cooked manti on a plate, drizzle the garlic yogurt sauce on top, and then drizzle with the melted butter and pepper mixture. Garnish with dried mint or parsley, if desired.
    </li>
    </ol>

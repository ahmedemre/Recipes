<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Turkish lentil soup, known as "mercimek çorbasi," is a staple in Turkish cuisine, known for its creamy texture, earthy flavor, and warming spices.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red lentils, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium potato, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp tomato paste (optional, for a richer flavor)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>5 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h4>Prepare the Ingredients:</h4>
    Rinse the red lentils thoroughly until the water runs clear to remove any starch. Chop the onion, carrot, and potato into small pieces to ensure even cooking.</li>

    <li><h4>Sauté the Vegetables:</h4>
    In a large pot, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.
    Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
    Add garlic, tomato paste (if using), cumin, and paprika, stirring for another minute to let the flavors blend.</li>

    <li><h4>Cook the Soup:</h4>
    Add the chopped carrot, potato, and rinsed lentils to the pot, and stir to coat them with the spices and oil.
    Pour in the water or vegetable broth, then add salt and pepper.
    Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils and vegetables are very soft.</li>

    <li><h4>Blend the Soup:</h4>
    Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. If you prefer a chunkier texture, blend only partially or skip this step.
    Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.</li>

    <li><h4>Serve:</h4>
    Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with fresh lemon wedges. A squeeze of lemon adds brightness and enhances the flavors.
    Optionally, drizzle a little extra olive oil or sprinkle some red pepper flakes on top for an extra kick.</li>
    </ol>
